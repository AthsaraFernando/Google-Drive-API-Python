# Google-Drive-API-Python
1) this program uploads the already existing text.txt file to the google drive
2) to run this code we should have the credentials.json file which needs to be downloaded from https://console.cloud.google.com/apis
3) the credential-fake.json file is only a dummy (we should have the original one to run)
4) in this program we have to sign in each time we run the code (upload a file)

! NOTE ! - credential.json file have sensitive date so don't publish that publicaly.
           remember to install the relevant libraries before running.
